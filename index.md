This is the personal site of Byron Wall, chemical engineer and programmer.  It includes a blog, portfolio and bio section.

I created this site to catalog the experience I have, ongoing projects, and to document a problem or two with a blog.  I program on the side to scratch an intellectual itch and solve problems.  I am also interested in programming full time, so this is an exhibition of my work as well.

To learn more about what I can and have done, check out the [about me page]() or look at the [projects]() I have completed.  If you want to see source code, head over to [GitHub]().
