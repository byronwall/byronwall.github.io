This is the personal site of Byron Wall, chemical engineer and programmer.  It includes a blog, portfolio and bio section.

This site catalogs the experience I have, ongoing projects, and documents a problem or two with a blog.  I program on the side to scratch an intellectual itch and solve problems.  I am interested in programming full time, so this is also an exhibition of my previous work to that end.

To learn more about what I can and have done, check out the [about me page](/about) or look at the [projects](/projects) I have completed.  If you want to see source code, head over to [GitHub](http://github.com/byronwall).
