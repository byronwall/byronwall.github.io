This is the personal site of Byron Wall, chemical engineer and programmer.  It includes a blog, portfolio and bio section.

This site exists to catalog my experience, ongoing projects, and document a problem or two with a blog.  I am interested in programming full time (i.e. employment) so this site is an exhibition of my skills to that end.

To learn more about my work, check out the [about me page](/about) or look at the [projects](/projects) I have completed.  If you want to see source code, head over to [GitHub](http://github.com/byronwall).
