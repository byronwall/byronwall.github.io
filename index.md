Personal site of Byron Wall, chemical engineer and programmer.

This site catalogs my experience, ongoing projects, and documents a problem or two with a blog. I am looking for a full time software job. [You should hire me!](/assets/resume_byron_wall.pdf)

To learn more about my work, check out the [about me page](/about) or look at the [projects](/projects) I have completed. If you want to see source code, head over to [GitHub](http://github.com/byronwall).
