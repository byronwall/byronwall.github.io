Personal site of Byron Wall, chemical engineer and programmer. This site catalogs my experience, ongoing projects, and documents a problem or two with a blog. I've been programming in various forms for the last 15 years. In the last 5 years I've been extensively using C# and JavaScript/TypeScript to build desktop software, React front ends, and Node.JS back ends.

I am looking for a full time software job.
