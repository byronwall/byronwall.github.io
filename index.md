Personal site of Byron Wall, chemical engineer and programmer. This site catalogs my experience, ongoing projects, and documents a problem or two with a blog. I've been programming in various forms for the last 15 years. In the last 5 years I've been extensively using C# and React/TypeScript to solve engineering problems.

I am looking for a full time software job. Check out [my resume](/assets/resume_byron_wall.pdf) for my experience and skills.

My major work is detailed in the [**React Portfolio**](/project/react-portfolio/) and [**C# Portfolio**](/project/c-sharp/).

For a quick look at a React project I made, check out the [HN Offline](https://hn.byroni.us) site or its [source on Github](https://github.com/byronwall/hn-client).

For an example of technical writing style and problem solving, check out a [couple](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30547953/split-rows-that-have-multiline-text-and-single-line-text) of [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30805665/how-to-create-a-dynamic-table-in-excel/30808646#30808646) [answers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30764752/change-value-in-adjacent-cell-via-click-vba-right/30766351#30766351).

I am also writing a book about using VBA in Excel. That effort lives [on Github](https://github.com/byronwall/excel-vba-book) or you can [read the rough draft](https://github.com/byronwall/excel-vba-book/raw/master/builds/book.pdf).
