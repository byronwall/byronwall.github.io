I am a Chemical Engineer by degree and experience and have a passion for programming.  In the engineering environment, I program to solve problems, automate common tasks, and visualize and analyze data.  Beyond engineering, I program to solve problems, try new technologies, and scratch an intellectual itch.

This site exists to catalog my experience, ongoing projects, and document a problem or two with an ongoing blog.  I am interested in programming full time (i.e. employment) so this site is an exhibition of my skills to that end.

##skills / experience
I have been involved in programming since I was 14.  Back then (ca. 2002), I was using yahoo! over 28k dialup to answer questions like: ``"how to make an .exe?"``.  These queries went nowhere so I hit the library to find a book on the topic.  I started with a book on Java.  When I went back to get another one, I mistakenly grabbed a book on Javascript, not knowing there was a difference.  Since then, I've enjoyed both web and desktop development!

I have dabbled in most popular languages and list them here by experience level.  For specific projects, check out the projects page for a more descriptive listing of what was created.  Most of the code for is over on GitHub if I still have it.

###know and use(d) regularly
This list includes anything I could sit down with today and start typing.  I am currently (or previously was) working with these technologies on a regular basis.  I am reasonably able to answer Stack Overflow questions on these topics.

 - [C#][1]
   - C# is a solid choice in the corporate group policy world because it exists and runs on nearly every Windows computer.
   - Experience with WinForms and WPF on desktop and ASP.NET for the web
 - [Excel / VBA](/project/excel/)
   - Excel **essential** for a practicing engineer.  I use it daily for calculations and VBA for automation.
   - I have developed some serious spreadsheets and add-ins and have also trained others in a formal setting.
 - [PHP](/project/runndaily-portfolio-page/)
   - PHP used to be my go to for web development but now is avoided like the plague.  It's a shame jQuery copied the `$` because it was such a drag typing that all the time.
   - runnDAILY was built from scratch with PHP on the backend.  This included building an MVC framework and templating engine.
 - [Javascript / CSS / HTML](/project/html-css-javascript/)
     - The front end web stack is where I have the most fun lately, mostly using d3 for data visualization.
     - When building runnDAILY, got to know the Google Maps library and JQuery.
 - [R](/project/kaggle-contest-portfolio/)
   - Have been using R for Kaggle contests to do analysis and visualization (ggplot2).
 - SQL
   - Used MySQL when working with PHP and SQLite for C# and Java projects where a single file DB is plenty.
   - Interacted with Oracle databases as well for pulling quality data at the plant.
 - Version control
   - Use Git locally and GitHub, previously ran a Subversion server for runnDAILY and other projects.

###have used
This list includes those technologies that I did more than nothing but less than a lot.  With a reference book and 30 Stack Overflow tabs, I could type, erase, curse, retype and ultimately put together decent code.

 - [Java](/project/java-and-spring-rts-ai/)
   - Built a Spring RTS AI for Balanced Annihilation using Java.
   - Way back I learned Java by making a program that calculated molecular weights of compounds.
 - Python
   - Used Python at Purdue for physics classes and side projects.  Looking for a good project to tackle here.
 - C
   - Everyone uses C at some point, right?  I used it at Purdue for a couple of classes.
 - Fortran
   - Who uses Fortran anymore?  Also used at Purdue because... it handles complex numbers natively?
 - Matlab
   - Matlab was the environment of choice for serious analysis at Purdue.  Used it for graphics and dynamic simulations of systems.

###have seen
This final list includes technologies that I have seen and possibly read some code.  I include it to shamelessly pad the list a little and make explicit (by omission) all those technologies that I have never dealt with (F# anyone?).

 - LISP, Ruby, PERL, C++, VB.NET
