##bio
I am a Chemical Engineer by degree and experience and have always had a passion for programming.  In the engineering environment, I program to solve problems, automate common tasks, and visualize and analyze data.  Beyond engineering, I love programming to solve problems, to try new technologies, and to scratch an intellectual itch.

There was a brief period at Purdue where I contemplated going all-in on programming.  I built a running website, runnDAILY, with my brother Chandler.  If I didn't get a job in Houston making plastic, I would have gone down that path.

This site exists to catalog the experience I have, ongoing projects, and hopefully solve a problem or two with an ongoing blog.  I contemplate programming full time so this site is both an exhibition of my work and a place to scratch the itch.

##skills
I have been involved in programming since I was 14.  Back then (ca. 2002), I was using yahoo (?) over 28k dialup to answer questions like: ``"how to make an .exe?"``.  These queries went nowhere so I tried out the local library to find a book to answer that question.  I started with a book on Java.  When I went back to get another one, I mistakenly grabbed a book on Javascript thinking there was no difference.  That's how I got my first taste of doing desktop and web.

Since then, I have dabbled in most popular languages.  I list them here by experience level.  For specific projects, check out the projects page for a more descriptive listing of what was created.  The code for anything mentioned is over on GitHub.

###know and use(d) regularly
This list includes anything I could sit down with today and start typing.  I am currently (or previously was) working with these technologies on a regular basis.  I am reasonably able to answer Stackoverflow questions on these topics.
 - C#
   - C# is a solid choice in the corporate group policy world because it exists and runs on nearly every Windows computer.
   - Experience with WinForms and WPF on the desktop side of things
   - Experience with ASP.NET for the web
   - I've read C# in a Nutshell cover to cover twice now and have attempted to use most of the core features: Threading, LINQ, databases, RegEx, Charting, Excel Interop, etc.
 - Excel / VBA
   - Excel is not taken serious by most serious programmers, but for a practicing engineering, it is **essential**.  I use Excel daily for some sort of calculation and VBA for automation.
   - Excel / VBA is also essential in the group policy world because most corporations allow macro enabled code to run.  In that world, I have experience training others and developing serious add-ins and spreadsheets.
 - PHP
   - PHP used to be my go to for web development.
   - My most serious project, runnDAILY, was built from scratch with PHP on the backend.  I built an MVC framework and templating engine to go with it.
   - I avoid it like the plague now but could sometimes miss typing `$` on every line. Always good to be thinking about the `$$$`.
 - Javascript / CSS / HTML
     - The front end web stack is where I have had the most fun lately, mostly using d3 for data visualization.
     - When building runnDAILY, got to know the Google Maps library and JQuery.
 - R
   - Have been using R lately for Kaggle contests. They are a good introduction to the language and modeling techniques.
   - ggplot2 is a great way to get crisp graphics from a large dataset.  I have found it easier than Excel for certain types of graphics.

###have used
This list includes those technologies that I did more than nothing but less than a lot.  With a reference book and 30 Stackoverflow tabs, I could type, erase, curse, retype and ultimately reach a target.
 - Java
   - Built a Spring RTS AI for Balanced Annihilation using Java.
   - Way back when  I learned how to program with Java by making a progrma that could calculate molecular weights of compounds.
 - Python
   - Used Python at Purdue for a couple of physics classes and side projects.  Looking for a good project to get going here.  Almost did the Kaggle competitions with Python but really wanted to learn R instead.
 - C
   - I guess everyone uses C at some point right?  I used it at Purdue for a couple of classes.
 - Fortran
   - I guess no one uses Fortran ever, right?  Also used at Purdue for a couple of classes.  It handles complex numbers natively... that's cool.
 - Matlab
   - Matlab was the environment of choice for serious analysis at Purdue.  Used it for graphics and dynamic simulations of systems.

###have seen
This final list includes technologies that I have seen and possibly read some code.  I include it to shamelessly pad the list a little and make explicit (by omission) all those technologies that I have never dealt with (F# anyone?).
 - LISP, Ruby, PERL, C++, VB.NET
